 ### Project Description:
The Nothwind Queries Project embodies a fusion of best practices in programming and data analysis. Using **PostgreSQL**, **PgAdmin 4** interface, **PgPlsql**, and **SQL**, this initiative is centered around the dynamic and vast database of Northwind data.

Through the adapted DDL script of Northwind, it became possible to successfully create the Microsoft-originated database on PostgreSQL. This transformation provided a solid foundation for the formulation of a variety of queries, enabling a versatile exploration of the data and fostering a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies within the database structure.


Taking advantage of the richness of the data in this database, a sequence of queries was created for the purpose of analyzing the data. In these analyses, the following functions were used **COUNT**, **SUM**, **MIN**, **MAX**, **AVG**, **UPPER**, **LOWER**, **INITCAP**, **LENGTH**, **SUBSTRING**, **REPLACE**, **DATE_PART**, **AGE**, **CEILING**, **FLOOR**, **ROUND**, **TRUNC**, **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, **CREATE VIEW**, **ALTER VIEW**, **DROP VIEW**, **CREATE FUNCTION** and **DROP FUNCTION**.

With this project, it was possible to enhance and refine skills in SQL, gain a deeper understanding of the PostgreSQL IDE, PLpgSQL, and related technologies.
